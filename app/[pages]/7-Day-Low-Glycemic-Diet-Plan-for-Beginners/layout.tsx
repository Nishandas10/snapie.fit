It keeps you feeling full longer, reduces insulin levels (helping your body burn fat more efficiently), and naturally reduces cravings for sugary, high-calorie foods.

Many healthcare providers recommend using a glycemic index food chart to help diabetics make better food choices. However, if you're taking diabetes medication (especially insulin), always consult with your healthcare provider before making dietary changes.",
